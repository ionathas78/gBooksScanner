> Gotta read 'em all!

React has a lot of possibilities, and the way it can refresh components
on the screen is compelling. It matched up well with the Google Books API,
which has a stupidly exciting amount of information. I wanted to put the two
together with a Mongo database that would make the match useful.
The basic interface came out fairly well. I wanted to add a Detail page that
would spell out the full data for a book in a single page, but I didn't have
a chance to get it working. I'm hoping to add that in the future.


## User Story

```
AS A reader
I WANT to be able to search and save Google Books
SO THAT I can keep track of my reading list
```

```
GIVEN THAT Google Books has the books I want to read
WHEN I search a book
THEN I want a list of the hits with authors and synopses
WHEN I see a book I like
THEN I can click the link to visit it on Google Books
WHEN I want to keep a book
THEN I can save it to a database
```
